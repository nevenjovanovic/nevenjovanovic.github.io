# Annotating morphology and lemmata in Greek texts

Experience has shown that the greatest shock for university students of Ancient Greek in Croatia, even when they had been taught Greek in high school, is encountering sentences and texts that the Greeks have actually written. We have tried to treat this shock by preparing a [Greek reader](https://github.com/nevenjovanovic/grcka-morfologija), 60 brief selections of Ancient Greek prose from Herodotus to Plotinus, carefully commented and cued to a standard (though outdated) school grammar; the idea is to read four selections each week during our 15-weeks semester. We are now in the second round of trying out the reader, and so far the approach seems to work. You can see another edition of the texts supported by the [Alpheios tools](http://alpheios.net/) at our [Eklogai site](http://croala.ffzg.unizg.hr/eklogai/).

A team of the older students helped prepare a digital, clearly structured grammatical and lexical commentary to selections in the reader. They have added the [ALDT grammatical codes](https://github.com/alpheios-project/arethusa/wiki/Creating-a-Morphological-Attribute-Configuration-File) and lemmata to the XML of tokenized texts. After reviewing, the texts have been enriched by bibliographic data and aligned to their CTS URNs wherever possible (the fact that the [Perseus Digital Library implemented CTS URNs](http://sites.tufts.edu/perseusupdates/beta-features/perseus-cts-api/) helped greatly).

# Another version of the commented edition, based on CTS URNs

A simple two-part digital publication demonstrates our knowledge of Greek grammar and lexicon, digitally encoded.

An example of a selection with our commentary is here: [Marci Aurelii ad se ipsum 3.1, cum analysi grammatica et lemmatibus](http://croala.ffzg.unizg.hr/grcgram/marcusaurelius3-1.html). Each word (and punctuation mark) has three types of notes – a reference to its lemma, a morphological description (in ALDT codes and, here, in Greek), and a CTS URN which is a live link.

From the other side, there is a proto-dictionary for our texts, [a list of all its lemata](http://croala.ffzg.unizg.hr/basex/grcmorf-lemmata). The frequency count in that list is also a live link, which leads to an index entry listing all forms which appear in the reader, their frequency, their morphology codes, and locations at which they occur; check out the example for the word [στρατηγός](http://croala.ffzg.unizg.hr/basex/grcmorf-occur/%CF%83%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%B3%CF%8C%CF%82) (links to locations eventually lead to the same page as the CTS URNs from selections with three sets of annotations, described above).

# Technology used and credits

The selections, prepared from CC-licensed texts published by the [Open Greek and Latin project](http://opengreekandlatin.org/) and the Perseus Digital Library, have been annotated and reviewed in [Perseids and Arethusa](https://sosol.perseids.org/sosol/signin). The repository is on Github: [grcka-morfologija](https://github.com/nevenjovanovic/grcka-morfologija) (it contains also LaTeX and Markdown sources for other versions of our reader). 

The CTS and CITE architecture is developed and described by Neel Smith and Christopher Blackwell at [cite-architecture.org](http://cite-architecture.org/) and its depositories. 

Chris Blackwell's wonderful [readingKits single-page CEX publications](http://folio2.furman.edu/readingKit/) provided a model for designing annotated texts. The index of forms has been inspired by [Syntacticus](http://syntacticus.org/), a PROIEL project.

The scripts for transforming XML, analyzing CTS URNs, and publishing results as HTML were written in XQuery and served by the [BaseX XML database](http://basex.org/). The HTML annotations are being shown by the jQuery plugin [Tooltipster](http://iamceege.github.io/tooltipster/).

Last, but under no circumstances the least, the student annotators, μέγα κῦδος ἀράμενοι, were Lovre Katić, Ivona Maleš, Klara Radovniković, Petar Soldo.

# What have we learned and where to go next

At the University of Zagreb, we want to add dictionary and, eventually, vocabulary exercises to our reader. We completely agree with a recent claim that [learning vocabulary and vocabulary acquisition are underrated activities](https://koine-greek.com/2019/12/15/some-thoughts-on-hebrew-and-greek-vocab-acquisition/) in learning historical languages. 

Besides, the extended exercise of annotating each word in 60 texts got us thinking about three sets of questions we propose below.

## Greek literature as L2 texts

Learning Ancient Greek (and Latin, and Biblical Hebrew, etc) is hard in part because the usual levels of foreign language proficiency (A1, A2, B1, B2...) cannot apply here. We learn Ancient Greek in order to read Plato and Aeschylus – imagine learning English for no other reason but to read Shakespeare, Faulkner, and T. S. Eliot. 

Certainly, in the vast corpus of Ancient Greek literature there are passages of simple prose, but we have to know what is simple (not Aesop's fables, from the grammar point of view), we have to find these passages, and we have to grade or order them by difficulty or proficiency level. 

All these problems have barely been tackled in Croatia.

## Usefulness of lemmata and grammatical annotations for learners

Having designed not one, but three ways of presenting information about lemma and grammar of a word, I am beginning to ask myself how useful this information actually is for a learner. This question should be experimentally researched. Would a group with access to our publications be more successful at learning the language, or translating a text, than a group relying on their memory and the dictionary?  Intuition suggest that perhaps a *treebank*, even one without any labels for word functions in sentences, would be more useful than description of morphology and lexicon (decoding morphology is, by the way, the activity most thoroughly practised in teaching historical languages today).

## Ambiguities of grammar and lemmatization

Annotating every last word in a Greek sentence is a challenging enterprise. It is challenging, however, in unexpected places. 

The students' work had to be corrected in points which we either never consider (because they are not important for understanding of the sentence), or which bring  to our understanding only very nuanced shades of meaning: having to decide whether an article, a pronoun, or a participle in genitive or dative is masculine or neuter; to say whether a "particle" is an adverb or a conjunction. 

Some solutions in Arethusa go against the scholarly instinct, such as when Arethusa offers to categorize an adverb as an adjective (for example, χαλεπῶς as a form of χαλεπός). The basis for lemmata in Arethusa was the wordlist of LSJ, in which, economically, the adverbs are described under adjectives (and the adverbs ending in -ον further complicate the issue); and, of course, it is possible to create our own lemmata if we're not satisfied with Arethusa's default offering; still, the current situation somehow tests the patience of a grammarian.

Something similar can be said for lemmata — to be able to decide between ἄν1 and ἄν2 (as offered by the lemmatizer in Arethusa) we have to know what is represented by the respective index number (luckily, here we can rely on [Logeion](https://logeion.uchicago.edu) or on Christopher Blackwell's [CEX edition of LSJ](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/index.html)). Lemmatization of Greek is, however, a serious issue that requires a robust general solution, supported by communities influential in classical philology and classical studies in general; more about that elsewhere.
