# Perseus Catalog and Scaife Viewer

Next step in enhancing our [Ancient Greek reader](https://bitbucket.org/nevenjovanovic/hellenismos/src) is to connect it with existing open digital resources for Ancient Greek. First, we turned to the [Perseus Digital Library](http://perseus.tufts.edu/), its wonderful [Catalog](http://catalog.perseus.org/), and its brand new and stylish [Scaife Digital Library Viewer](https://scaife.perseus.org/).

# State of the Viewer

In our reader there are 60 brief extracts from Ancient Greek prose, comprising authors from Herodotus to Plotinus. All passages have CTS URNs in the Perseus Catalog; 17 passages are absent from the Scaife Viewer, and an additional passage returns an *error* in the viewer (the issue has been [reported on Github](https://github.com/scaife-viewer/scaife-viewer/issues/308)).

Currently about **two thirds** of our selections are accessible in the Scaife Viewer. This is indicative of the current coverage of Ancient Greek literature there.

Not bad at all, but, of course, we hope that the extent will grow. Everybody can help!

A more detailed [list of our passages](https://bitbucket.org/nevenjovanovic/hellenismos-hypostates/wiki/ReportScaifeReader.md), with CTS URNs both for the Perseus Catalog and for the Scaife Viewer, is available in the wiki of the [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/nevenjovanovic/hellenismos-hypostates/).
